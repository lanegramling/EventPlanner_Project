The easiest way to get started is to download and install [Qt Creator](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/?hsCtaTracking=f977210e-de67-475f-a32b-65cec207fd03%7Cd62710cd-e1db-46aa-8d4d-2f1c1ffdacea).
Then the program can be built from within Qt Creator (recommended method) or built from the command line using
