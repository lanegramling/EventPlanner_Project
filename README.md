# Event Planner
This project aims to help people schedule events. In this program, we can create new events or join exsiting events that is available for you.

## Getting started
This instruction helps users intall program on their local machines regardless of operating systems.
### Installing
The open source IDE Qt Creator 4.x was used to run qmake for compilation.
The easiest way to get started is to download and install [Qt Creator](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/?hsCtaTracking=f977210e-de67-475f-a32b-65cec207fd03%7Cd62710cd-e1db-46aa-8d4d-2f1c1ffdacea).
Then the program can be built from within Qt Creator (recommended method) or built from the command line using
```
$ qmake
followed by...

If on linux:
$make

If on Windows:
$mingw32-make
or
$nmake
